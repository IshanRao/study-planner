## Reason for choice of TECH stack
- Reason for selecting the libraries like react-hook-form, zod and lucide-chart is that they were part of
another project I was working on and after some research, I got to know that they're are used widely in the industry.
- I have added them in this project to gain understanding of their capabilities and get hands on experience working with them.
- I also want to understand React toolkit(RTK) library, which I intend to incorporate later into this project.
For that reason, I have included the react-query library which I have heard is used in co-ordination with RTK
